# Element-isotopes
Haskell module containing isotopic masses and relative abundances for all elements from Hydrogen to Bismuth and Thorium and Uranium. The type synoyms IsotopeMass, IsotopeAbundance, ElementName, AtomicNumber, NumberOfNeutrons, IsotopeData and IntegerMass are provided and Isotope, Element and ElementSymbol data types are defined. Finally, functions are provided for accessing information such as average atomic masses and monoisotopic masses etc.
